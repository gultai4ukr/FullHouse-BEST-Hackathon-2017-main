# FullHouse-BEST-Hackathon-2017-main

This project was the main task for BEST Hackathon 2017, made by team Full House (SergChr, gultai4ukr, konchyts-v, AndriiSiuta and Yuriy Haliuk).

Main purpose of this work was creation of web service, which should be pretty, easy to use, well-designed, secured, original and provides suggestions of user wishes. Its obvious than task is very wide, complex and there were a lot of possible ways to do that, but they need big time investments. We build simple model, which is based on analysis of user query and returning relevant events in different categories. Many other investigated features we left partially implemented.
